## Hobbies

This Github account is for my geekier hobby interests and personal projects. This is not my day job. These repositories and projects are totally and completely unrelated to my professional role at Cottee Parker Architects:

- I’m currently working on a combination of Hesiod, DNSSEC, SSHFP and OpenPGP to create a distributed, signature backed, hardware 2FA name and auth single sign on 'system', without Kerberos or ldap, using existing commodity code and infrastructure as much as possible;
- I’m currently learning about Kerberos, ldap, DNS, OpenPGP cards and Git;
- I’m looking to collaborate on a KISS Linux package repository that updates then pulls from local git repositories under /usr/src/ rather than downloading full source each time. Step 2 is minimal i18n and l10n bolt on packages to ootb kiss linux;
- I’m looking for help with an elegant, simple and secure physical console login with an openpgp card based private key, without mounting home folders until after authentication has occured and without any unionfs type madness;
